# Supervisor Process for Dynamic File Access Control

## Overview

In a sandboxed execution environment, a **supervisor process** monitors file system operations of an untrusted "guest" process (the sandboxed code). The supervisor enforces a dynamic allow-list of file paths. Initially, the guest can only access a minimal set of safe files. As the guest tries to open new files, the supervisor intercepts those attempts and decides whether to allow them. Some file accesses are **auto-approved** based on predefined rules, while others pause the guest and require **human approval** before proceeding. This ensures tight security while still granting the guest any necessary file access on a case-by-case basis.

Below is a detailed step-by-step guide, with pseudo-code style explanations, for setting up such a supervisor process. We focus on low-level file-access interception and dynamic policy updates.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Outline

1. **Launch a Supervisor for the Session:**  
   For each sandbox session, start a dedicated supervisor process. This supervisor will oversee one guest process. (While a single persistent supervisor could handle multiple sessions, using one supervisor per guest is simpler to implement and isolate.)

2. **Initialize Allowed File List:**  
   Define an initial allow-list of file paths the guest can access from start. This might include essential libraries or config files required for basic operation (or even be empty if the guest should start with no file access). For example:

- allowed_paths \= {  
   "/usr/lib/essential_lib.so",
  "/tmp/guest_scratch/"  
  }

- This set will expand dynamically. The allow-list (policy store) can be in-memory for the session, since policy persistence is out of scope here.

3. **Set Up File-Access Interception Mechanism:**  
   Before launching the guest, the supervisor must **hook into file system calls** made by that guest. There are a few ways to achieve this:

4. **Seccomp User-Space Notification:** The guest process can be started with a seccomp filter that sends a notification to the supervisor on each file-access syscall (e.g. an open() or openat() system call). Using SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF, the kernel will pause the guest’s syscall and notify the supervisor, effectively delegating the decision to the supervisor[\[1\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=Overview%20In%20conventional%20usage%20of,implementing%20security%20policy%3B%20see%20NOTES)[\[2\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=the%20target%20is%20temporarily%20blocked,on%20the%20listening%20file%20descriptor).

5. **Fanotify with Permission Events:** The supervisor can use the Linux fanotify API in permission mode to listen for file open attempts by the guest. Fanotify will block the guest’s file access operation and wait until the supervisor approves or denies it[\[3\]](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/390655/can-fanotify-modify-files-before-access-by-other-applications#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20getting%20permission%20events,that%20you%20may%20have%20modified).

6. **Ptrace/System Call Interception:** The supervisor can act as a debugger on the guest process using ptrace to catch open system calls and suspend the guest at those calls.

**Low-Level Detail:** Regardless of method, the goal is that whenever the guest attempts to open a file, the supervisor is notified _before_ the file is actually accessed, and the guest is blocked (sleeping in kernel space) until a decision is made[\[2\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=the%20target%20is%20temporarily%20blocked,on%20the%20listening%20file%20descriptor)[\[3\]](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/390655/can-fanotify-modify-files-before-access-by-other-applications#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20getting%20permission%20events,that%20you%20may%20have%20modified). For example, with seccomp user notifications, the guest's thread is paused by the kernel and an event is queued for the supervisor, containing the syscall number and arguments (including the file path)[\[4\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=notification%20event%20is%20generated%20on,the%20listening%20file%20descriptor)[\[5\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=,in%20subsequent%20SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ID_VALID%20and%20SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND).

1. **Launch the Guest Process in Restricted Mode:**  
   Start the sandboxed guest process (e.g., via fork()/exec() or container runtime), applying the interception mechanism from step 3\. For instance, if using seccomp: install the seccomp filter in the guest process before it begins executing untrusted code. If using fanotify or ptrace: launch the process and immediately attach the supervisor to monitor it. The guest should run with minimal privileges (possibly as a non-root user, in a chroot or mount namespace with limited filesystem view, etc.), to limit damage if it tries something unexpected. The key is that any file open will trigger our intercept.

2. **Monitor File Access Events:**  
   Now the supervisor enters a loop waiting for file-access events from the guest. In pseudo-code:

- loop while guest_process is running:  
   event \= wait_for_file_open_event() // Blocks until guest tries to open a file  
   filepath \= event.requested_path // Get the file path the guest wants  
   ...

3. For seccomp: use ioctl(SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV) on the seccomp listener file descriptor to get the next syscall event[\[6\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=,NOTES%2C%20the%20file%20descriptor%20can) (this returns info including the syscall type and its arguments, like the path for open).

4. For fanotify: call read() on the fanotify file descriptor to receive an event structure when the guest attempts a file open. The event includes the file descriptor or inode and the operation (open, etc.), which can be converted to a path.

5. For ptrace: wait for a syscall-enter stop, check if it’s an open/openat call, then retrieve the path argument from the guest’s registers/memory.

6. **Check Against Allow-List:**  
   When an event arrives, the supervisor checks if the requested file path is already in the allowed_paths set.

7. **If the path is in the allow-list:** Approve the access immediately. The supervisor instructs the kernel to continue the syscall normally.
   - For seccomp: write a response with SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND indicating the syscall should be allowed (and optionally specify a return value if we were emulating, but here just allow it)[\[2\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=the%20target%20is%20temporarily%20blocked,on%20the%20listening%20file%20descriptor).

   - For fanotify: write an approval for the event (a fanotify response struct with FAN_ALLOW). The guest will then be unblocked and proceed to open the file.

   - For ptrace: simply let the syscall continue (e.g., using ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, ...) again to resume the guest).

8. **If the path is not in the allow-list:** This triggers a policy decision point. The supervisor must decide whether to allow this new file access and possibly update the allow-list. We handle this in the next steps.

9. **Auto-Approval for Certain Paths:**  
   The supervisor can automatically approve some categories of file access without human involvement, according to predefined rules. For example, one rule might be: allow read-only access to any file within a specific directory (say the guest’s own working directory or a temp folder), or allow creation of new files in /tmp/guest_scratch/. If the requested path qualifies for auto-approval:

10. **Add** the path (or a broader pattern, e.g. the directory) to allowed_paths. This expands the guest’s permissions dynamically.

11. **Approve** the file access event (same mechanism as above, e.g. send an "allow" response to the kernel).

12. Log this expansion for auditing (optional but good practice).

For example:

if is_auto_allowed(filepath):  
 allowed_paths.add(filepath)  
 allow_event(event) // resume guest, letting it access the file  
 continue loop

If the auto-approval covers an entire directory, the supervisor might add a pattern or all files under that directory to the allow-list in one go.

1. **Manual Approval for Other Paths:**  
   If the file path doesn’t fall under an auto-rule, the supervisor must involve a human decision (e.g., an administrator or the end-user) to approve or deny this access:

2. **Pause the guest:** The guest process is already blocked waiting for a decision (by the kernel/supervisor mechanism). Ensure it remains paused. (With ptrace or seccomp, it's automatically paused; with fanotify, it’s paused until reply[\[3\]](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/390655/can-fanotify-modify-files-before-access-by-other-applications#:~:text=When%20you%27re%20getting%20permission%20events,that%20you%20may%20have%20modified).)

3. **Notify a human operator:** This could be done by logging a message, sending an alert, or showing a prompt in a UI. Include details like which file is being accessed and by which session/process. For example:  
   _Alert:_ Guest process PID 1234 requests access to /home/user/secret.doc. Approve? (y/N)

4. **Wait for response:** The supervisor process should wait (perhaps blocking on a socket, GUI input, or reading from a control pipe) for the human’s decision. The guest remains suspended during this time.

5. **Human approves:** If the answer is to allow, add this path to the allowed_paths set (so that future accesses to the same file won’t prompt again). Then send an approval to the kernel to unblock the file access. The guest will continue and successfully open the file.

6. **Human denies:** If the access is disallowed, instruct the kernel to **deny the event**. There are a few ways to deny:
   - For seccomp, respond with an error code (e.g., set resp.val to \-EPERM) so the guest’s open syscall returns a permission error.

   - For fanotify, send a FAN_DENY response for that event, similarly causing an EACCES in the guest.

   - For ptrace, one can set the guest’s registers to indicate an error return and then resume, or simply kill the guest process if the policy is to terminate on a serious violation.  
     After denying, the guest’s open call will fail as if the OS refused permission. The supervisor can decide whether to let the guest continue running (despite the failed syscall) or terminate the guest if the operation was critical or suspicious.

The pseudo-code for this decision might look like:

else:  
 pause_guest(event) // ensure guest is paused (if not already)  
 decision \= get_human_approval(filepath)  
 if decision \== "approve":  
 allowed_paths.add(filepath)  
 allow_event(event) // resume guest with success  
 else:  
 deny_event(event) // e.g., make guest's syscall return an error  
 // (optionally terminate guest if policy dictates)

1. **Resume Monitoring:**  
   After handling the event (whether auto or manual), the supervisor returns to waiting for the next file access from the guest. The loop continues until the guest process exits or is terminated.

2. **Cleanup:**  
   Once the guest finishes execution, perform cleanup in the supervisor:
   - Close any monitoring file descriptors (seccomp listener, fanotify FD, etc.).

   - Possibly log the session’s allowed file list for auditing (to see what was accessed).

   - Terminate the supervisor process if it was one-per-session. (If a persistent supervisor handled multiple guests, it would now just free resources associated with that particular guest and be ready for the next one.)

Throughout this process, the allow-list is dynamically expanded to include any new files that have been deemed safe for the guest. The separation of concerns is clear: the guest doesn’t know about any of this supervision (it simply experiences “permission denied” errors or successful opens), and the policy logic – what is allowed automatically vs. what requires a person – resides entirely in the supervisor.

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance:** Intercepting every file open has some overhead. Seccomp and fanotify are fairly efficient in the kernel, but the round-trip to user-space for a decision will slow down access, especially when waiting for human input. Consider caching decisions or batching requests if performance is critical.

- **Security:** The supervisor should be the only process with the power to approve file accesses. It must run with privileges to intercept syscalls and to allow/deny them. The guest should run with minimal privileges. Even the supervisor should be careful – for example, if using seccomp user notifications, the kernel documentation notes it’s not meant to _enforce_ security alone[\[7\]](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html#:~:text=to%20treat%20a%20system%20call,implementing%20security%20policy%3B%20see%20NOTES), so the supervisor should be robust against malicious guest behavior (e.g. handle path traversal carefully, and not inadvertently allow more than intended).

- **Extensibility:** While we focused on file _open_ calls, a real implementation might also intercept other related syscalls (like mkdir, unlink, etc., if you want to supervise creation or deletion of files) and apply similar allow-list logic to them.

- **Single Supervisor for All Sessions:** In our outline we used one supervisor per guest for simplicity. If a single persistent supervisor process is used for all sessions, it would need to track allowed file sets per guest and include an identifier in each event (e.g., seccomp and fanotify events would include a process ID or handle to know which sandbox triggered it). A dispatcher would then route each event to the correct policy logic and user prompt. This is more complex but could be more resource-efficient for a large number of simultaneous guests.

By following these steps, you set up a supervisor that robustly monitors and controls file system access for sandboxed processes, dynamically adjusting permissions as needed with a mix of automatic rules and human oversight. This design ensures the guest only accesses what it truly needs, minimizing risk to the host system.
