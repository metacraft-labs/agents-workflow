# Restricting Guest Internet Access to a Whitelist of Websites

Controlling a guest’s network so it can **only access a specific whitelist of websites** is crucial for security. The goal is to allow the guest to reach only approved domains (and ports) and **nothing else**. This must be done under the constraint of **no root privileges on the host**. Below we discuss the challenges and multiple approaches – from user-space networking tricks to proxies and DNS controls – to enforce a whitelist-only policy for guest internet access.

## Challenges in Whitelisting Network Access (Without Root)

Enforcing an outbound whitelist at the network level is non-trivial without root. Traditional firewalls (iptables/nftables) require root and work at the IP level, not domain name. This means **domain-based rules** are hard – you’d have to constantly resolve domains to IPs and update rules. As one engineer noted, _“most firewalls work with IP addresses but not DNS domain names,”_ so maintaining an up-to-date list of IPs for allowed domains is cumbersome[\[1\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=,refresh%20your%20firewall%20configuration%20periodically). Without root, we cannot simply install kernel firewall rules globally.

Another challenge is that **DNS itself can be exploited**. Even if direct connections are blocked, a malicious guest might use DNS queries to communicate out (encoding data in domain lookups). DNS is often left open because it seems harmless, but attackers can use techniques like _DNS tunneling_ to exfiltrate data or receive commands via DNS queries[\[2\]](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-dns-tunneling#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20DNS%20tunneling%20uses%20the,system%20and%20their%20command%20server). Therefore, a robust solution should consider restricting DNS or monitoring it, even if DNS needs to function for allowed sites.

In summary, we need a strategy that (a) works without full root privileges, (b) enforces an _allowlist_ of external destinations (by domain/IP and port), and ideally (c) prevents misuse of DNS as a side-channel. Below are approaches to achieve this.

## Unprivileged User-Space Networking (SLIRP)

One method is to leverage **user-space networking** so that the guest’s internet access is mediated by a program running in user mode. For example, QEMU’s _“user networking”_ (SLIRP) provides a virtual NAT network entirely in user-space[\[3\]](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#:~:text=User%20Networking%20). This allows a VM/guest to reach the internet without any tap device or root privileges on the host. Rootless container engines use a similar mechanism (e.g. slirp4netns) to give containers outbound connectivity when running as unprivileged users[\[4\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html)[\[5\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html).

By default, SLIRP will NAT the guest’s traffic to the outside world as if it were a normal host behind NAT. That means without further controls, the guest could connect to any address/port. However, QEMU offers a _“restrict”_ option for user networking. Using \-netdev user,restrict=yes **completely isolates the guest from the host and external network** by default[\[6\]](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#:~:text=You%20can%20isolate%20the%20guest,options). In this mode, the guest still has a network interface (and can talk to other virtual devices or services QEMU provides), but _any attempt to reach the wider internet is blocked_ – preventing malware from “phoning home”[\[6\]](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#:~:text=You%20can%20isolate%20the%20guest,options). You can then **selectively open holes** in this restriction using controlled forwards. For example, QEMU allows specifying hostfwd or guestfwd rules to forward guest traffic to specific destinations. In practice, this could mean forwarding only certain host ports or addresses that correspond to whitelisted sites. Essentially, SLIRP with restrict=on flips the model to _“deny by default”_ and you explicitly **allow only what you trust**.

**Pros:** This approach is fully unprivileged and self-contained. It doesn’t require host firewall rules – the filtering is handled in user-space. It’s suitable if you are using QEMU or a similar VM wrapper and can take advantage of its built-in options. For containers, slirp4netns doesn’t (currently) have a built-in allowlist feature, but you could potentially achieve a similar effect by modifying the slirp code or wrapping it with logic to drop disallowed connections. The key is that since the network stack is in userland, **you can augment it with checks**. (For example, one could patch or use an LD_PRELOAD on the connect() calls that slirp makes to the host, to filter outgoing connections against an IP whitelist.)

**Cons:** Vanilla slirp by itself doesn’t know about domain names – rules would apply at IP/port level. Managing a list of allowed IPs (especially if domains have many IPs or change) can be complex. Also, while QEMU’s restrict option blocks all outbound traffic (which is secure), configuring fine-grained exceptions might require complex forwarding rules or custom code. There’s also a performance cost to user-space networking (slirp is slower than a direct interface).

## Isolated Network Namespace with Internal Firewall

Another technique is to use Linux network namespaces to our advantage. Even as an unprivileged user, on many systems you can create a new user namespace and a new network namespace (unshare \-U \-n) – this gives you a sandboxed network environment where **you are effectively root _inside that namespace_** (with CAP_NET_ADMIN in the namespace), though not on the real host. In that isolated netns, you can set up a virtual interface and apply firewall rules (iptables or nftables) that **only affect the guest’s traffic**. This is how rootless container engines can apply certain networking rules without touching the host’s global firewall[\[7\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html).

For example, with rootless Podman, one can enter the container’s network namespace and use iptables to block or allow specific IP ranges; those iptables rules will only impact that container’s networking, not the host[\[7\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html). We can use this capability to implement an allowlist: \- **Create a new network namespace** for the guest. \- Run a user-space NAT (like slirp4netns or even a simple TUN/TAP \+ userland forwarder) to connect that namespace to the internet. The guest will have an interface (say eth0 or tap0) in this namespace. \- Inside the namespace, configure iptables to **DROP all outbound traffic by default**, and then **ACCEPT outbound to the whitelisted IPs/ports**. For instance, you might allow TCP to IP X on port 443, IP Y on port 443, etc., for each allowed website’s resolved IP addresses. All other destinations would hit the DROP rule. This way, even though the NAT process might try to open a socket to an unallowed IP, the packet never leaves the namespace (iptables will block it). \- The guest should also be prevented from altering these rules – but since the guest’s processes are unprivileged (not root in the namespace), and your orchestrator set the rules as the namespace’s root, the guest can’t change the firewall.

This approach was demonstrated by practitioners: one solution for rootless Podman used a **netns hook to inject iptables rules** at container startup, ensuring only specific IPs were reachable by that container[\[8\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html). It leverages the fact that we can be root _within_ the container’s own namespace to enforce policy, while the host remains unprivileged.

**Pros:** This gives very strong enforcement at a low level – even if the guest tries to create raw sockets or use non-HTTP protocols, the kernel (in the namespace) will enforce the rules. It’s like giving the guest its own miniature firewall. And importantly, it still doesn’t require root on the host (only the ability to use user namespaces, which is generally allowed on modern Linux with unprivileged user namespaces enabled).

**Cons:** Setting this up is more involved. You need to have the iptables/nft tool available and coordinate the networking. Also, maintaining the IP whitelist (if domains change IPs) means you’d have to update rules as needed. There’s a slight privilege escalation in that you _do_ run iptables (which is a privileged operation) but only in a contained scope – one must ensure the guest can’t escape that scope. This is generally safe if user namespaces are properly configured.

_Note:_ New Linux features like **cgroup eBPF filters** can also enforce outbound IP rules per process or cgroup. For example, systemd’s IPAddressAllow= setting uses cgroup BPF under the hood to allow or deny specific IP ranges for a service[\[9\]](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/249/systemd.resource-control.html#:~:text=following%20rules%20are%20applied%20in,turn)[\[10\]](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/249/systemd.resource-control.html#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20implement%20an,relevant%20services%2C%20and%20only%20them). Using such BPF mechanisms, one could in theory attach a filter to the guest process that only permits certain addresses. However, loading such eBPF programs typically requires privileges (CAP_BPF or CAP_SYS_ADMIN). If you have a helper daemon or systemd in play, this could be leveraged – but in pure unprivileged scenarios, it’s not trivial to use. Thus, the netns \+ iptables method is more straightforward for most cases.

## Application-Level Proxy and Domain-Based Filtering

When the goal is to restrict _web_ access to certain domains, an **application-layer proxy** can be an elegant solution. Instead of trying to handle every packet at the kernel level, you allow the guest to send requests but funnel them through a proxy that enforces the whitelist by domain name.

One approach is to run an HTTP/HTTPS proxy (like **Squid**) on the host (or a sidecar container). The guest would be configured to use this proxy for all web requests. The proxy can be set up with an ACL that _only allows certain domains_ and denies all others. For example, Squid can whitelist domains or even only specific URLs. If the guest tries to bypass the proxy, you would combine this with a firewall rule that blocks direct HTTP/HTTPS traffic (so the only way out is via the proxy). In a fully unprivileged setting, you might not have a host firewall to enforce using the proxy, but you could achieve it by network namespace routing tricks (e.g., only route the proxy’s IP, and no default route for others).

Another clever variant (used in a Docker scenario) is to deploy **per-domain proxies using Nginx**. In that design, the container’s internal network had no direct internet, but for each allowed domain (say example.com), there was an Nginx instance joined to both the internal network and the external network. The Nginx was configured in TCP stream mode to forward traffic to example.com on port 443\. The container’s DNS was set so that example.com resolved to the Nginx’s internal IP[\[11\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=An%20important%20point%20is%20that,and%20know%20the%20destination%20domain). Thus, when the container tried to reach example.com, it actually hit the Nginx proxy internally, which then relayed the bytes to the real example.com. Any other domain had no such proxy and would fail to resolve or connect. As the author of this method noted, _“inside docker containers, only traffic to the allowed domains will be possible.”_[\[12\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=With%20this%20setup%2C%20no%20outbound,allowed%20domains%20will%20be%20possible) This ensures **domain-level whitelisting** even for HTTPS (since Nginx in stream mode doesn’t terminate SSL, it just pipes it through, so the guest sees a real certificate from the real site, avoiding cert issues).

**Pros:** Domain-based control is much easier to manage when you have a proxy, because you don’t have to manually chase IP addresses. If a site’s IP changes, DNS and the proxy take care of it as long as the domain is allowed. Also, proxies can log and audit what the guest is accessing. This approach can be done without root on the host (you can run a proxy as user). In fact, the Nginx-per-domain trick was done entirely with user-level tools in Docker Compose[\[13\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=After%20a%20lot%20of%20searching%2C,The%20core%20ideas)[\[14\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=can%E2%80%99t%20really%20proxy%20outbound%20SSL,and%20know%20the%20destination%20domain).

**Cons:** The guest could theoretically try to use non-HTTP protocols or IP addresses directly to circumvent the proxy. So you either need to also block all other traffic (which brings us back to a firewall or namespace restriction), or ensure the guest environment is such that only web traffic is expected. Also, maintaining one proxy per domain (in the Nginx method) can become unwieldy if the list is long. A single proxy with a domain ACL is easier, but then you must enforce its usage. In scenarios where you truly cannot apply any host firewall, the guest might simply ignore the proxy settings – so this approach works best when the environment is controlled enough that you can assume or enforce proxy usage (for example, the guest code is known to use HTTP only and you configure its environment accordingly).

In short, proxies are powerful for **whitelisting by domain**. They can be used in conjunction with the other methods: e.g., run the guest in a netns that only allows traffic to the proxy’s IP/port – thus the guest has to go through the proxy, which then enforces domain rules. This combined strategy covers both IP-level and domain-level filtering.

## DNS and Port Considerations

Even if the guest is limited to certain external sites, **DNS resolution** must be handled carefully. The guest will need to resolve the allowed domain names to connect. If you leave the guest with a general-purpose DNS (like 8.8.8.8 or the host’s resolver), it could query arbitrary domains. Those queries themselves could leak data. For example, malware could perform lookups like \<secret data\>.attacker.com and, even if it can’t connect out by TCP, the DNS query reaching an external DNS server might carry the secret in the hostname. As Palo Alto’s security researchers note, _DNS tunneling_ is a known method to covertly send data by encoding it in DNS queries/responses[\[2\]](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-dns-tunneling#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20DNS%20tunneling%20uses%20the,system%20and%20their%20command%20server). Thus, completely **unrestricted DNS is a potential communication channel**.

To mitigate this, you have a few options: \- **Whitelist DNS Queries:** Use a DNS server that only answers for your allowed domains. You can run a local DNS (e.g., dnsmasq) for the guest. Populate it with the A records for the whitelisted sites (or forward those queries to real DNS) but make it return NXDOMAIN or refuse queries for anything else. This way, even DNS queries are effectively on a whitelist. \- **Default DNS but monitor/block:** Alternatively, allow the guest to use normal DNS but combine it with the IP-level restrictions. Even if the guest resolves an disallowed site, it cannot connect to it. This doesn’t stop data exfil via the query itself, but it limits what the guest can actually reach. Depending on your threat model, you might accept this risk if you believe DNS tunneling is unlikely or you have other detection in place. \- **No external DNS at all:** In a very locked-down case, you could avoid giving the guest any real DNS server. Instead, supply an /etc/hosts file inside the guest with the required domain-\>IP mappings for the whitelisted sites. That way, the guest never needs to query DNS for those sites, and any other DNS queries will just fail. This is simple but only feasible if the set of sites is small and mostly static in IP.

Also, consider **port whitelisting** as part of the policy. If the allowed use case is web browsing or API calls, likely only TCP port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) should be open. You should restrict or block all other outgoing port numbers. For instance, even if example.com is allowed, you probably don’t want the guest to connect to example.com:22 (SSH) or some high port, in case a malware tries to use an alternate service on the same host. This is typically handled in the firewall rules (e.g., allow only port 443 to the IP of example.com, not any port) or via proxies (an HTTP proxy won’t proxy non-HTTP protocols). Linux’s new Landlock security module is interesting here – it allows a process (even unprivileged) to restrict itself to only making TCP connections on certain port numbers[\[15\]](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#:~:text=For%20network%20access,a%20specific%20action%3A%20HTTPS%20connections). For example, you could lock a process to _only_ allow LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP on port 443[\[15\]](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#:~:text=For%20network%20access,a%20specific%20action%3A%20HTTPS%20connections). That would enforce that even if it somehow tried to connect to a disallowed port, the kernel would block it. However, Landlock (as of ABI v4) doesn’t filter by destination IP, only by port, so it’s a coarse tool (you’d still need something to restrict which IPs it can reach). It’s a new avenue to be aware of for unprivileged network restricting.

## Summary and Recommendations

To **restrict a guest’s internet access to a specific whitelist** of sites without root privileges, consider a combination of the methods above for defense-in-depth. Key approaches include:

- **User-Space NAT with Allowlist Controls:** Use an unprivileged networking stack like QEMU’s SLIRP or slirp4netns to provide NAT connectivity, and enable restrictive mode. For instance, QEMU’s restrict=yes cuts off all outbound traffic by default (no phoning home) and you then explicitly forward/allow only the approved sites or ports[\[6\]](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#:~:text=You%20can%20isolate%20the%20guest,options). This approach requires no root and is a good starting point for VM sandboxing.

- **Network Namespace \+ Internal Firewall:** Create a separate network namespace for the guest (via user namespaces so it’s rootless on the host). Inside that namespace, apply iptables/nft rules that **whitelist specific IP addresses and ports** and drop everything else. This effectively gives the guest its own firewall that you control[\[7\]](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network.1.html). The guest will only be able to send packets to the allowed destinations. This requires some setup (bringing up the interface, NAT or forwarding for internet access, etc.), but it’s powerful. The host remains untouched by these rules.

- **Application-Layer Proxy (Domain Whitelisting):** If applicable, funnel the guest’s traffic through a proxy server that permits only certain domains. For web access, a proxy can enforce an ACL by domain name, which is much simpler than maintaining IP lists. You might run a local Squid proxy or use the Nginx TCP proxy technique to pass-through to allowed sites[\[14\]](https://fruty.medium.com/how-to-restrict-outbound-traffic-on-a-docker-infrastructure-7effc45e313d#:~:text=can%E2%80%99t%20really%20proxy%20outbound%20SSL,and%20know%20the%20destination%20domain). Ensure the guest cannot bypass the proxy (e.g., by blocking direct internet routes, so only the proxy is reachable from the guest). This method is especially useful for HTTPS, since the proxy (in pass-through mode) doesn’t need to decrypt traffic – it just controls the destination.

- **DNS and Ports Restrictions:** Don’t forget to restrict _where_ the guest can resolve names and which ports it can use. If possible, provide a filtered DNS service that only resolves whitelisted domains, to close the DNS tunneling loophole[\[2\]](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-dns-tunneling#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20DNS%20tunneling%20uses%20the,system%20and%20their%20command%20server). Limit outgoing connections to the standard ports (80/443 or others explicitly needed) – all other ports should be blocked to prevent abuse. This can be done via firewall rules (e.g., only allow tcp/443 to allowed IPs) or via mechanisms like Landlock if available[\[15\]](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#:~:text=For%20network%20access,a%20specific%20action%3A%20HTTPS%20connections).

In practice, a **combined solution** often works best. For example, you might run the guest in a locked-down network namespace with slirp (for rootless NAT) and iptables rules allowing only specific IPs:ports. At the same time, you could run a DNS server that only resolves approved hosts for that namespace, and maybe even force HTTP traffic through a proxy for logging. These layers together greatly reduce the chance of the guest reaching anything outside the whitelist or leaking data out-of-band.

If a fully unprivileged solution proves too difficult (for instance, maybe your scenario doesn’t allow user namespaces or you can’t easily implement slirp filtering), you might employ a minimal privilege on the host: e.g., a helper service with CAP_NET_ADMIN that sets up iptables rules on the host for the guest’s traffic, or using systemd’s built-in IP allowlisting for the service. But in most cases, the approaches outlined can be achieved without giving the main guest process any root rights on the host.

By carefully **whitelisting at multiple layers** (network layer and DNS/application layer), you can confidently allow the guest to access needed sites (with proper name resolution), while **ensuring it cannot contact or attack anything else**. This dramatically limits the potential for abuse – even if the guest is running untrusted code, it can only talk to the small set of external endpoints you’ve approved, on the ports you’ve allowed.
