When you a given a task description or developer instructions that
just state "go", execute the shell command \`${GET_TASK_CMD}\` and
follow the instructions provided in the output.

Only when the task description or developer instructions are not
"go", take a look at the WEBUI_TASK_INSTRUCTIONS.md file and honor
all instructions provided there.

cat > ../WEBUI_TASK_INSTRUCTIONS.md << EOF
Before starting work, I'd like you to do the following:

1) mkdir -p ".agents/tasks/\$(date -u +%Y)/\$(date -u +%m)"
2) In this directory, create a file with a verbatim copy of the task
description or developer instructions. The file should be named exactly
"\$(date -u +%d-%H%M)-\${TASK_BRANCH_NAME}.txt", where \$TASK_BRANCH_NAME
is an appropriate short branch name that would describe well the task
description or developer instructions.

When you are given follow-up task description/developer instructions,
or a QA review, append a verbatim copy to the same task file. You can
make sure the file is the same by inspecting its contents which should
match the original message. Use the separator "--- FOLLOW UP TASK ---"
to indicate where the new content has been appended.

Before starting work on the follow-up task, take note of the current
HEAD commit. I'd like this commit to be preserved. Don't squash it
with other commits at the end of the task.

In general, when you complete a task or a follow task, take a look
at the changes introduced in this specific coding session and write
a detailed summary of them in a single commit for each coding session.
