        Please note that during development, certain commands will fail because
        you don't have access to the internet.

        All URLs mentioned in the task description(s) have been downloaded
        to the /workspace/internet_resources directory.

        If it's difficult for you to achieve a task without access to additional
        internet resources, you can always propose more URLs that we should make
        available offline.

        Downloading development, dependencies may also fail to download due
        to the lack of internet connectivity. We are trying to maintain the
        script `.agents/build_all_targets.sh` that is also executed before
        your development session starts while your computer is still connected
        to the internet.

        The script tries to run all build commands that have development
        dependencies in order to cache the dependencies for offline use.
        Please propose changes to this script when you introduce new build
        targets with dependencies.

        When you need to consult the documentation or source code modules
        for a particular dependency, always try to find where this dependency
        have been downloaded and try to access the necessary files through
        the file system (i.e. depending on the programming language, the
        operating system and the package manager being used, they should
        be in their standard location).
