**Milestone 5: Full Integration and CI/CD Pipeline**
*Implementation:* Integrate all components and establish comprehensive CI testing:

* **CI Matrix Enhancement:** Add test jobs for different OS/filesystem combinations:
  - Ubuntu with btrfs support
  - Ubuntu with overlay-only (simulating basic ext4 systems)
  - macOS with Docker/Colima simulation
  - Windows with WSL2/Docker simulation
* **End-to-End Testing:** Test complete workflows from `agent-task` CLI invocation through workspace creation, agent execution, and cleanup.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Add benchmarks for snapshot creation/destruction, file sync performance, and concurrent agent execution. Set performance regression thresholds.
* **Documentation and Examples:** Complete user documentation with setup instructions for each platform, credential configuration guides, and troubleshooting sections.

*Integration Testing:* The CI pipeline will run the full test suite across the matrix of supported platforms and configurations. This includes both unit tests of individual components and integration tests of complete workflows. All tests will run against real filesystem operations and network conditions to catch issues that mocks might miss.
