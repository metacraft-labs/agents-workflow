I want a single, holistic configuration schema for Agents‑Workflow.

TOML maps closely to JSON, so using JSON Schema to validate TOML (parse TOML → JSON → validate) seems practical. Please keep it DRY by defining shared enums and shapes once (e.g., supported agents, runtimes, task runners, log levels, modes, etc.) and reusing them across the configuration.

We should have one schema for the entire configuration that the CLI can validate against, and editors (like Taplo) can use for IntelliSense.

Also, I’d like JSON Schema validation and review tools available in the dev shell: taplo-cli and ajv-cli; and I’d like to try Docson for viewing the schema.
