The `start-work` binary should gain some new command-line parameters: 

1) `--autopush`: besides the current git configuration commands, it should install a
post-commit hook that automatically force pushes the commit to the `target_remote`
(the goal is the push the commit even when the push is not a fast-forward push). 

The use of the new flag should be suggested in the GIT_MESSAGE inserted when `get-task`
is launched with `--autopush`. The current instructions for executing git push at the
end of the task can be removed now.

2) `--task-description` and `--branch-name`. Specifying those should result in creating
or modifying an existing task description file, by following similar logic to the
`agent-task` command when not given a branch:

If we are currently not on an agent branch, the command should create a task description
file and commit it immediately just like `agent-task` does, but without creating a new
branch or pushing it to the remote (the `--branch-name` argument will affect only the
name of the task description file).

if, we are already on an agent branch (e.g. `start-work` was already called and it
created a commit with a `Start-Agent-Branch` tag in the commit message), append the
new task description to the existing task file just like `agent-task` does when not
given a branch name. The `--branch-name` parameter will be ignored in this situation.

The use of `start-work` with the new flags will be suggested in the AGENTS.md file
created by `codex-setup` instead of the current manual instructions.

Make sure to refactor the code to not  introduce unnecessary code duplication between
`agent-task` and `start-work`

Please add tests for `start-work` that check that the described behavior works.
Before two invocations of `start-work`, there might be multiple commits.
