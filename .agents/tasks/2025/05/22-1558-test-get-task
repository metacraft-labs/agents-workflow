Your task is to expand the test suite with a test for the `get-task` command.
Please note that the command is not implemented correctly at the moment.

The test should do the following:

After `start-task` completes, switch into the created branch.
Running `get-task` here should print the message specified with the editor
while executing `start-task`.

Potential design issue in the code:

Since the `get-task` command is intended for AI agents that will run it in
automated workflows, sometimes these agents will switch to their own git branch
before their coding session begins.

In other words, `start-task` create a branch for the task and we launch the
coding agent there, but it immediately switches to another branch `work` which
may trip the logic in the code that tries to identify where the task branch
starts.

I suggest adding additional tests for this scenario.
