Your previous task was:

Make the ruby scripts and libraries available in this repo installable as
a Ruby gem.

Besides testing all binaries directly, the test suite should make sure all
cases work when the files when the executable were installed as a gem.
This should be easy to achieve, just pass the gem binary names into the
parametric tests.

Finally, create additional simple ruby scripts that import the gems and
executes the operations that simulates the execution of `agent-task` and
`get-task`. Execute all test scenarios with these scripts as well (again,
by passing the names of the created binaries in the parametric test suite).

You've made good progress so far, but I'd like you to make the following
changes:

Instead of having multiple gems, have a single gem with multiple binaries

In the scripts/gem_get_task.rb and scripts/gem_get_task.rb that are used
within the tests, don't call the gem binaries. Instead, use functions
exported by the gem (the goal is to test that the public API of gem works).

You'll need to update the tests and the README.
