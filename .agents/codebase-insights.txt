# Critical Architecture Notes

## VCS Abstraction
- VCSRepo helper abstracts Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Fossil commands
- When writing task files, use binary mode to avoid CRLF conversion on Windows

## Test Architecture Requirements
- Parent directory tests require repos to be on agent task branches (not main)
- AgentTasks.new() constructor only recognizes repos on agent task branches
- Tests must call `VCSRepo.new(repo).checkout_branch('feat')` after `run_agent_task()` calls

## Token Usage
- Authentication for GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket is handled via `~/.netrc` which
  is configured during `codex-setup` if the respective `*_TOKEN` environment
  variables are present. The token is no longer injected in remote URLs.

## EXTRAS Framework
- Ruby-based component installation system via `bin/install-extras`
- Set EXTRAS="nix,direnv,cachix" with flexible delimiter parsing
- Uses Rake tasks in Rakefile.extras for dependency resolution
